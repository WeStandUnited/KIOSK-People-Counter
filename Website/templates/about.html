I attend SUNY Oswego as a Computer Science BS major, gradutating Spring of 2021. When I'm not avoiding the plague, I enjoy traveling, hiking, gaming, and photographing my adventures. When I joined this team to work on the Kiosk People Counter, it was my first time working with a team to develop a large piece of software, and also my first time being tasked with implementing any sort of body/facial recognition software. Although the task seemed daunting, the process turned out to be a very fulfilling and educational experience. With the help of my colleague, Billy Bowling, we were able to successfully implement a working body detection algorithm as well as facial tracking and recognition algorithms for identifying known faces. I’d like to give a big thanks to my team for their support and their contributions to this project, as well as a shoutout to our project manager, Prof. Tenbergen, for motivating our success and keeping us on track!</p>

I attend SUNY Oswego as a Computer Science BS major, graduating Spring 2021. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, gaming, and spending time with my girlfriend Olivia. When I joined this team to work on the Kiosk People Counter, it was my second time working with a team to develop a large piece of software, but this was my first time creating a website to this extent. With the small amount of previous experience I was able to get the ball rolling, however, thanks to the assistance my team, I was able to complete this task. Also, a special thanks to Cj Chiasson and Robert Netti for their help in improving the base website I created to become a website with a very professional design and improved capabilities from the original. I'd lastly like to give a shoutout to our project manager Prof. Tenbergen, for continuing to push us to create the best product we can produce, and for motivating us to stay on top of our task that made us able to finish this earlier than expected!</p>

                <p style="text-align:center;margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;max-width: 50%;  ">Hey ! My name is Gregory Maldonado, I’m 19 and from Cortlandt Manor located in Westchester County, NY. At the time of the completion of this project, I am a first semester sophomore hoping to graduate by Fall 2022. When I’m not programming, I’m either hanging out with friends or cashing people out at Old Navy. During this project, I helped Billy and Rob merging together the body recognition features while also writing the algorithm for tracking and counting the people that walk by. The project came together very nice at the end and would like to thank the team for working hard and cooperatively to reach a common goal. We finished 3 weeks earlier than the actual due date and this couldn’t have been accomplished without teamwork! Go Team D!</p>

                <p style="text-align:center;margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;max-width: 50%;  ">Hi , I'm Cj Chiasson I worked on the backend and misc. team coordinating , currently I am president of the Computer Science Association. When I'm not programming I usually am playing my ukulele ,guitar , or making pastel art. Super happy to have worked with all of my team members on this project can't wait to see each and every one of them succeed in this world. I'd like to end with a quote from Fred Rogers. “In times of stress, the best thing we can do for each other is to listen with our ears and our hearts and to be assured that our questions are just as important as our answers.”- Mr. Rogers.

                <p style="text-align:center;margin-right: auto;margin-left: auto;max-width: 50%;  ">My name is Billy Bowling, I am 20 years old and I am from Islip, NY. I attend SUNY Oswego as a Computer Science BS Major, and I plan to graduate Spring of 2022. When I have free time, I enjoy playing soccer, roller hockey, and hanging out with my friends. When I joined this team, it was also my first time working with a team to develop a large piece of software, as well as my first time working with human body detection. I ended up learning a lot about how human tracking / body detection works, as well as how face detection works. With the help of my colleague, Robert Netti, we were able to successfully implement a working body detection algorithm as well as a facial tracking and recognition algorithm for identifying known faces. I would like to give a huge thank you to my team as they were always supportive and helpful when dealing with this project. I would also like to give a huge thank you to Prof. Tenbergen, as he always gave us meaningful input that allowed us to stay on track and have success in this course.</p>
